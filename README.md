## Hi, Iâ€™m @nikfp! ðŸ˜‰
Iâ€™m interested in js, ts, rust, and getting really really good with unix systems. 

I'm an enthusiastic hobby developer that likes to observe, learn, and write about tech.

Iâ€™m currently learning Rust for fun, and Lua to help me configure and customize my Neovim setup. 

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source work surrounding the Jamstack ecosystem and developer tools in Lua. 

I have a thing with ducks. There is some history there that I might tell you about sometime.
