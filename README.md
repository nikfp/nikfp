## Hi, Iâ€™m @nikfp! ðŸ˜‰
Iâ€™m interested in js, ts, rust, and getting really really good with unix systems. 

I'm a long time hobby developer and a serial side project starter. I enjoy building things with code in a variety of technologies to better understand how it all fits together. I also enjoy thinking about the more esoteric and philosophical aspects of technology, how tech affects people, and how tech affects people's relationships with each other.   

Iâ€™m currently learning Rust for fun, and Lua to help me configure and customize my Neovim setup. 

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source work surrounding the Jamstack ecosystem and developer tools in Lua. 

I have a thing with ducks. There is some history there that I might tell you about sometime.
