<h2 align="center">Hi, Iâ€™m @nikfp! ðŸ˜‰</h2>
<p align="center">Iâ€™m interested in js, ts, distributed systems, and using code to make life easier.</p>

<p align="center">I'm a long time hobby developer and a serial side project starter. I enjoy building things with code in a variety of technologies to better understand how it all fits together. I also enjoy thinking about the more esoteric and philosophical aspects of technology, how tech affects people, and how tech affects people's relationships with each other.</p>   

<p align="center">Iâ€™m currently learning Rust for fun, occasionally hacking on my Neovim setup, and building an app called <a href="https://github.com/nikfp/NoteTree">NoteTree</a> that is a nested notes app with markdown support, that runs on serverless environments and a Postgres database. (Still in early days though)</p>

<p align="center">Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source work surrounding the Jamstack ecosystem and developer tools in general. </p>

<p align="center">I have a thing with ducks. There is some history there that I might tell you about sometime.</p>
